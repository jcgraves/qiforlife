I began seeing Dr. Zhang almost two years ago for chronic lung issues related to allergies. Her technique is different from the other acupuncture practices I've been to. Compassionate and a master in her craft, Dr. Zhang's approach to healing is less intrusive than western medicine and more sympathetic to the body's internal mechanisms to find its right balance. In my two years with Dr. Zhang, I not only feel phenomenal, but I've also received an insightful education on the beauty of eastern medicine and how it views the body. She is a master at her craft and understands the delicate interweaving of body and mind for holistic health.
