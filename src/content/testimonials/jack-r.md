In my three years of coming to the clinic to see Dr. Zhang, she has always been kind and compassionate. Also during my hard time, she has helped my neuropathy immensely to the point I no longer have pain in my hands and feet and have only a small amount of residual numbness in my toes. She also has greatly helped my immune system as I fight a (currently) incurable form of cancer. The oncologists have marveled at how well I responded to the last treatment, but it is no coincidence that she was treating me with acupuncture throughout the treatment. I do not say thank her enough, but I am forever grateful to her. God has given her a sharp mind, unique healing skills, a kind heart, and a servant attitude. I hope she never tires of helping others.
