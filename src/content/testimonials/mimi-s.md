Dr. Li Zhang is incredible and it is so evident she cares about her patients. She really takes the time to get to know your story and then works with you to help find relief for pain or any other health problems. Each visit she takes the time to really listen to see how you are doing after the last visit. She goes above and beyond to make sure her patients feel comfortable and cared for. The facility is always kept to the highest cleaning standard but she also creates an environment where the patient is really able to relax and rest. Her attention to patient care is what truly makes her exceptional. She is a blessing to our community!
