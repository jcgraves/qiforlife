Highly recommend Dr. Zhang! I've gone to her for a couple issues and both cleared up after a few treatments. Not only did the problems go away, but I felt more energetic, happier, calmer, and healthier than I had before. Her treatment isn't just temporary—it has changed my life in countless ways and the effects last for years. She is caring, compassionate, and the best at what she does. I've been to a couple acupuncturists, and there's no comparison. Dr. Zhang is the best.
