I found Dr. Zhang online looking for a good acupuncturist. Since the first visit I felt very comfortable and she was able to treat several issues at the same time (migraine, fertility problem, night sweats, and some more). I started to see improvements right away. Now, after like 7 months of treatments I am pregnant with my second baby and I know I couldn't be in better hands. I wouldn't change Dr. Zhang for any other acupuncturist.
