I can't say enough good things about Dr. Zhang. When I started going to her a few years ago I was pretty close to giving up on my knee and having knee replacement surgery. I was having a very difficult time walking with a lot of pain and stiffness. I was doing Supartz and cortisone shots a couple of times with diminishing effectiveness. Based on a recommendation from a friend I decided to give acupuncture a try. I was pretty skeptical but figured why not at least try it for a couple of months. The results have been fantastic. It's been several years and I can gladly say that I am no where near knee replacement surgery. My knees still get sore from time to time but the recovery time is much, much shorter. She made a believer out this skeptic, for sure!
