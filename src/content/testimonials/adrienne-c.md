I was referred to Dr. Li Zhang at Qi for Life by my massage therapist. I had always been interested in acupuncture, but the idea that poking little needles into my skin could be healthful was a bit of a stretch for me. What finally caused me to go was experiencing many symptoms over a long time that I couldn't easily attribute to a particular illness—things like fatigue, night sweats, weight gain. I finally wrote them down and there were 10 different symptoms. I decided to go to an internal medicine doctor for a physical. The doctor finished the checkup and told me that I was fine—nothing was wrong with me. She had no explanation for my symptoms other than to tell me sometimes we get these things.

When I showed up to Dr. Zhang's office, she had me complete quite a bit of paperwork. I was more than a little skeptical and deliberately left off some information that might lead her to diagnose the symptoms I was having. I figured if she was for real, she would figure out my symptoms through the magic of acupuncture. When she showed me into her treatment room, the first thing she did was look at my nails, my tongue and then spent about 3-5 minutes feeling my pulse. From those actions alone, she immediately told me that I was probably experiencing 8 out 10 of my symptoms! Then, she asked key questions that directly related to those and the other 2 symptoms. I was almost in tears. How could she know??

In terms of results, I have been going for regular treatment for 8 months. Most all of the symptoms have gone away. I can breathe like I haven't in years—so much so that I have started running again. My fatigue and night sweats are also gone. I had some numbness in my foot which is completely gone and I had had that numbness for several years! I will continue to go back as needed and have referred Dr. Zhang to most everyone I know. I was a skeptic but no more!
