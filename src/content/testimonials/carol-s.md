Dr. Zhang, you had mentioned to me that you thought my skin color was better since I've been getting my treatments. I mentioned that to my husband a week or so ago. From a man who doesn't say much about "looks" I was really excited when he told me this morning that he thought Dr. Zhang was right—that my skin did look better. It must look really better for him to notice and comment. So, thank you, for your marvelous talent to help people get better.
