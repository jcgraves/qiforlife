After 5 years of foot pain (caused by prominent bone spurs on the tops of my feet and compounded by arthritis), after seeing an orthopedic surgeon and a podiatrist, after wearing shoe inserts in all my shoes, after having ultrasound and physical therapy treatments, after rubbing expensive cream on my feet and taking over-the-counter and prescribed pain meds, and after being told that surgery was the answer to remove the bone spurs (that would involve 8 weeks in a wheelchair) I finally got smart! I made my first appointment with Dr. Zhang about 5 months ago.

Dr. Zhang's credentials and Chinese training experience are impeccable and that experience and confidence from many years of practice made me feel comfortable on my first visit. In addition to the acupuncture, Dr. Zhang treated my bone spurs with Chinese Herbs and had some recommendations for an eating regimen. By the end of the third month my bone spurs had gone down in size so much that it was visible to my family. I began to wear something besides tennis shoes and I was able to be on my feet for many hours. I can now wear shoes that I have not been able to wear for many years comfortably. I am able to go up and down most stairways like an adult person instead of looking like a toddler.
