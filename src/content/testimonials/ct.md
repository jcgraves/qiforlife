Excellent experience with Dr. Li Zhang. I was referred by a family member and have since referred several other family, friends, and coworkers. After years of trying traditional medicine and various diets, this is the only treatment plan that helped me with auto-immune issues. Dr. Li Zhang has been very honest with me, and clearly explained that my treatment would take time to see results. I trusted her and began healing faster than anticipated. She has created a treatment plan just for me, not a general plan for every patient, and explained that everyone is different and will need various techniques and timeframes for different issues. What I initially thought of as a "last resort" will now be my first option when seeking for health solutions. I can't explain how it all works, but it has changed my life.
