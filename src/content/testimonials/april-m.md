I went to Dr. Zhang for four months based on an initial recommendation by a friend with the primary presenting concern of infertility, along with seasonal allergies, decreased energy, and overall health. My husband and I received treatment from a local fertility clinic and tried to conceive for 3 years, with no success. Before turning to IVF as a last result, I decided to see Dr. Zhang. Even after the first appointment, I immediately felt better (general energy and relief from allergies). My overall Qi seemed to improve with each visit, and within a month, we were pregnant! Dr. Zhang is a third-generation acupuncturist with a high success rate for treating infertility. She certainly helped us, and I feel so much better overall! Highly recommend.
