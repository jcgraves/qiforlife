I got a baby girl! I was trying to get pregnant for two years, never succeeded. My OBGYN suggested me to try IVF, but the infertility specialist doctor told me that my successful chance will be very low due to age and eggs quality, I was depressed. My friend asked me to try Dr. Zhang, she told me Dr. Zhang had helped her before. I made an appointment, Dr. Zhang touched my pulse, looked my tongue and asked me a bunch of questions, then she said she could help me. She asked me to get acupuncture treatments for six months before I did egg retrieval. I came once a week for six months, then started my IVF procedure and I got pregnant in the first IVF trying. I was so excited and the amazing thing is when I visited Dr. Zhang, she told me I would have a baby girl by touching my pulse, and my ultrasound showed I had a girl later.
