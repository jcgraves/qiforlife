How fortunate we are to have a medical professional available to us in Dr. Zhang. Most of us have experienced that all the training in the world, the brightest minds, do not necessarily possess and use understanding, compassion and intuition.

Dr. Zhang learned the science and art of acupuncture from the Masters in China, the birthplace of acupuncture. She has been through medical school in China and believes that traditional western medicine and non traditional medicine can work hand in hand at different times and different ways for a variety of maladies.

My personal experience with Dr. Zhang over the past 2½ years has been physically and emotionally rewarding. She has demonstrated time and again with me the capacity of her wealth of knowledge in the correct diagnosis and acupuncture applications. I have found in her the wonderful ability to read and understand my body and my feelings. She has been able to redirect my body into a better pain free and pain managed order that my system has embraced with the benefits of being pain free and a feeling of happiness and contentment that I had not felt in many years.

I have been treated by 3 other acupuncturists in my adult life. Compared with Dr. Zhang I have found them all lacking in their ability to help me the way she has. With her training, empathy, intuition, and wonderful sense of humor, I feel confident you will be delighted with the treatment that Dr. Zhang will recommend and administer.
