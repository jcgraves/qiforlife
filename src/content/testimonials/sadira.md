I have known Dr. Zhang since 2008. She is one of the best acupuncturists in the United States and also a medical doctor in China, coming from a lineage of third-generation acupuncturists. She has helped me manage work-related stress, allergies, insomnia, asthma, hives, and even assisted me in getting pregnant. Over the past 15 years, I have referred hundreds of people to her, and all have been highly satisfied. Thanks to her expertise, six of my friends have also successfully conceived. When I returned to see her after many years, she could understand my life situation and body just by taking my pulse and looking at my tongue. Her talent is truly remarkable, and she always encourages me to practice forgiveness. She is a gift to Middle Tennessee. We are blessed to have her.
