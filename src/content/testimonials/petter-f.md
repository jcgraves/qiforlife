Dr. Zhang is the best Acupuncture doctor I have ever visited. She is a second generation Chinese doctor who has the background and knowledge that exceeds anyone else I have ever experienced; there is no comparison to how I feel after a session with her compared to other acupuncturists that I have tried. I leave feeling great! Dr. Zhang is a true healer! I recommend her to everyone I meet who is looking for an Acupuncturist.
