I was having fertility issues for over a year, and was at a local fertility clinic for about 7 months. Someone recommended that I try acupuncture along side my fertility treatments and highly recommended Dr. Zhang. After meeting with Dr. Zhang I was beyond impressed with her knowledge, and her compassion she has for her patients. I was becoming exhausted with my fertility clinic and after 3 failed IUI's Dr. Zhang suggested I give my body a break from fertility treatments and just do acupuncture for a little while. I trusted her more than any other doctor I had been working with and I took her advice. I was completely off fertility medication for 3 months and became pregnant all on my own with the help of acupuncture! Dr. Zhang worked with me all through my first trimester and continues to work with me through my second trimester as well. She is there for me every step of the way providing the best care possible, and for this being my first pregnancy, I am so thankful to have Dr. Zhang.
