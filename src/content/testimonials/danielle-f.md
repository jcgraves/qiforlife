I started seeing Dr. Li Zhang in the midst of my fertility treatments. Prior to receiving treatment from her, I had three failed rounds of clomid, followed by 3 failed rounds of injections/IUI. My AMH levels are a 0.3 and my body was struggling to produce even one egg each round of injections as I haven't been ovulating on my own for years. I was losing faith and was willing to try anything. My doctors were even suggesting donor eggs since my egg quality was so low. I began my acupuncture before the 4th round. I followed Dr. Li's instructions and came twice a week religiously throughout my entire cycle. She provided a warm environment, confident guidance, and a service that despite my hatred for needles was surprisingly relaxing. That one round of treatment in combination with her acupuncture (which was the ONLY thing different from all the other rounds) blessed my husband and I with TWINS. I'm now 7 weeks pregnant with fraternal twins and believe whole heartedly that it would not have been possible without her.
