I am the last person who thought they'd ever try acupuncture, but my allergies were so bad they were affecting my job. I had tried every western medical treatment—inhalers, pills, etc., and none worked. In fact, the side effects of all the drugs worsened my condition. I felt better immediately after my first acupuncture treatment, and now, after about 4 months, I feel cured!! It has been an amazing blessing for which I am very grateful. Dr. Zhang is a highly trained doctor, very punctual & precise—you rarely have to wait. She is excellent at diagnosing root causes, and she is a warm, caring individual.
