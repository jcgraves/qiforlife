Qi for Life is wonderful—Dr. Zhang is terrific. I had never gone to acupuncture before but after a year of back pain, doctors, chiropractors, and physical therapy, I was willing to give anything a try. I felt some relief the first visit and it has steadily improved my level of pain. I originally went weekly, and now have even skipped a few weeks. I have recommended Dr. Zhang to four different friends for all different reasons. Three of my friends have gone and have found it beneficial as well. Dr. Zhang herself is efficient, caring, and very eager for you to improve and move on. I have not felt pressure to "sign up" for x amount of visits, she seems to know it is an individual experience. I would highly recommend her to anyone.
