Almost three years ago I had a terrible fall after a summer of physical therapy for Cervical Radiculopathy. I was in severe pain, could barely walk, with continuous back spasms. Both of my legs were bruised from my waist to mid calf. I couldn't tolerate any more pain. I had searched online for something to help me other than pain pills and muscle relaxers around the clock. I wanted to return to work, tend my garden and take care of my grandson.

Dr. Li Zhang is a highly qualified OMD, who trained and taught in China. I met with Dr. Zhang who actually listened to my history and past medical treatments, medications, and most importantly my goals. After looking at my back and legs she agreed to work with me towards my goal of getting better without multiple pain medications. After 20 minutes on her table my back began to relax. I had several hours of needed relief. I returned to Dr. Zhang every week for 10 weeks. By the end of 15 weeks I was able to work in my garden and to clean my house without assistance. Soon thereafter returned to work and my hobbies. I continue to see Dr. Li Zhang every 2 weeks as this helps with my severe arthritis in my back and neck.
