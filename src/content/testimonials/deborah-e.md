I was on an antidepressant medication for about 4 years. I hadn't had a normal period in about 12 years. I was going through a tough time in my life and I was worrying way too much. It had gotten to a point that it was affecting everything I did. Worrying was consuming me. I wanted to find another way to help myself. I chose acupuncture after I did my research.

After first time treatment I felt change in my energy level and my depression less, I am in better mood. After Dr. Zhang treated me three times I had my first very normal period last week and it lasted about 4 1/2 days, after seven treatments I have had tons of energy and I have been in the best mood, I'm sleeping like a baby at night. I feel amazing. And I've lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks! I'm telling you if you have anything that is bothering you physically or emotionally you should check out with Dr. Zhang. I'm paying to have it done, but remember I am medicine free now, and I'm feeling great. I thank God everyday for leading me to her!!! She's the best!
