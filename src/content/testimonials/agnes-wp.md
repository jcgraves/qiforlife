Dr. Zhang is awesome! I first saw her a few years ago when my husband and I were trying to conceive. She is a very nice person. Personable, knowledgeable, informative, kind and gentle, very serious about her work, but at the same time has a sense of humor and is very easy to talk to. We conceived our child after only a couple of months of seeing Dr. Zhang. Our family has then moved out of state, and I have had a really difficult time trying to find another acupuncturist in my new state whose knowledge and skills could match the levels that Dr. Zhang possesses. I would highly recommend Dr. Zhang to anyone wanting to improve their health or deal with any medical issues. She is fantastic!
