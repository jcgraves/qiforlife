I have been seeing Dr. Zhang for about 2 years now and the results have been nothing short of miraculous. I have had six knee surgeries over the years (4 on my left knee and 2 on my right). The build up of arthritis and the deterioration of the joints over the years left me where it was difficult to walk long distances or even to stand for long periods. Stairs were a challenge and any sort of running was out of the question. Stiffness/swelling and pain were just part of my daily routine.

I had been going to an orthopedic knee doctor for several years to get cortisone and Hyaluronan injections every six months to ease the pain. The injections worked for a while but I had reached the point where I was seriously considering knee replacement surgery. Being only in my 50s I was reluctant to do knee replacement at such a "young" age. A friend who also has bad knees recommended I try acupuncture treatment with Dr. Zhang.

Dr. Zhang did more than just treat my knees. She changed my diet and treated me for stress as well. It took a couple of months before my knees started to feel better but I noticed that I was sleeping better almost immediately. After 6 months my knees felt better than they've felt in over 10 years. I can now do almost anything I want to do, including even running for short distances. I can happily say that knee replacement surgery is not even a consideration any more. My knees feel great, my stress levels are much lower, and I sleep GREAT. I feel younger and healthier than ever.
