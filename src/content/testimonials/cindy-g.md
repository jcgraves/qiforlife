Thank you Dr. Zhang! Just wanted to drop a note and tell you thank you. I so appreciate you, your wonderful skills, your knowledge. The care you give to me in helping me get my health back. Which is priceless. I also wanted you to know, that the eye swelling of being outside this morning... the swelling is almost gone... thanks to you!! Only a tiny bit swollen. In the past I would have been swollen and horrible sick for at least 4 to 5 days. Thank you!!!!! I am very very blessed to have found treatment with you and wanted you to know.
