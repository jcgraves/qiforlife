Dr. Zhang is an exceedingly skilled practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The greater Nashville area is lucky to have her. She is a true master of this complete medical system. Dr. Zhang is able to rapidly reach a spot on diagnosis and know what treatment modality will work best for you: acupuncture, herbs, cupping, etc. As a patient, you're always at ease. She instills that sort of confidence.

Better than all of that? She is one of the kindest and most thoughtful people you'll encounter. Dr. Zhang meets you and your health where you are. She cares and listens. She offers to help and goes out of her way to do so.

I have been a patient of Dr. Zhang's for some time now. She has treated and started to reverse a condition for which other doctors and medical professionals told me there isn't any lasting treatment. But it hasn't been easy or simple to do so. Of course, Dr. Zhang told me from the outset things would take time but could be done. She gave me realistic expectations, not false hope. Now, many months after starting treatment, each day I'm grateful for Dr. Zhang and her caring, effective treatments which have improved my daily living dramatically.
