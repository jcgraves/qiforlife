I have had alopecia totalis (full hair loss on scalp) for over 15 years. I have had painful steroid shots in my scalp, contact sensitizers, shampoos, supplements—name it, I have tried them all. After years passed, I was resigned to having to wear wigs all of my life. Two of my close friends had both struggled with fertility issues & after visiting Dr. Zhang they both were able to get pregnant! I was sold. Dr. Zhang is a miracle worker! Not only is she one of the kindest people I know—she really knows her stuff! Since beginning acupuncture & herb treatment last December, my hair is almost completely grown back!!! I am so grateful to Dr. Zhang and I highly recommend her to anyone and everyone!!
