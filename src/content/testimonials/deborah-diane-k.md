When I first began visiting Dr. Zhang several months ago, I had widespread moderate to severe pain over most of my body. I had two large nodes, one on each side of my left knee; each one about the size of a large orange. I could barely go up steps or at times walk without severe pain. I could not move my shoulders without severe pain. I had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but I did not want to take prescription medications due to side effects from them.

The treatments were painful, but as she told me "no pain, no gain", and this was true, the pain was in passing, the results will last a lifetime. I will never forget one of her most telling statements to me that helped me to see what a wonderful, caring Dr. she is: She said, "my patients are my passion." Since I have been going to Dr. Zhang, the large nodes on my knees have disappeared, my shoulders are well and no pain on movement. My outlook is much more positive, my memory is better. My liver, kidneys and heart continue to heal. I would say do not wait until all other options are exhausted before going to Dr. Zhang, go to her first. You will never regret it, and you will be forever grateful for a Dr. who cares for her patients in the most deeply caring, compassionate, way possible.
