I have been a patient of Dr. Zhang for couple of months now. Having been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome, I was always tired from many sleepless nights. Not wanting to take medication for this with all its side effects, I came to Dr. Zhang for help. Here I am two months later sleeping like a baby at night with no restless legs. What she has done for me through acupuncture is truly amazing! With her quiet, personable, and caring manner, thorough knowledge of the human body, and ability to analyze your needs very quickly, she is a true miracle worker!
