      "description": "Follow-up visits include a shorter intake period before treatment, generally lasting 40-60 minutes. The number of treatments needed depends on your age, gender, and the duration, severity, and nature of your condition. Most patients feel improvement after 3-6 sessions, with significant results typically seen after 10 or more treatments."

      "description": "Acupuncture needles are extremely thin—about the size of a thick human hair—and produce feelings such as tingling, warmth, pressure  when inserted. Many patients relax deeply or even fall asleep during treatment. Needles remain in place for 30 to 45 minutes while you rest with soothing music in a warm room.",
