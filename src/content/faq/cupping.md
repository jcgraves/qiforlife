question: "What is Cupping?"
order: 7
---

Cupping is the use of suction cups to remove impure energy from the body. It involves lighting a match in a small, rounded "cup" made of glass, bamboo or pottery, and then removing it quickly and applying the cup to the skin. The flame creates a vacuum and the cup sticks tightly to the skin.

Cupping is used in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as the common cold, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Cupping is also used to treat back, neck, shoulder, and other musculoskeletal pain. It is common for cupping to produce bruise-like marks or blisters on the body. These marks are signs that toxins are being released from the body and will usually go away within a few days or a week. You will need to wait 24 hours to shower after cupping treatment.
