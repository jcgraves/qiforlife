  Dr. Zhang will choose methods according to her diagnosis for what you need.
  During acupuncture, full attention will be given to help you relax and receive
  the most value from the treatment. After each needle is inserted, you may feel
  nothing, or sometimes a vague numbness, heaviness, or slight tingling.
  However, the treatment is effective whether these feelings are sensed or not.


  The needles will be left in for 35 to 45 minutes while you relax with soothing music in a warm room. After the treatment, you may experience a relaxing euphoric feeling.
