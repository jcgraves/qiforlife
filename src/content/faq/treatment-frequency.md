The number of treatments needed depends on the patient's age, gender, and the duration, severity, and nature of the complaint. Usually, after three or six sessions, people will feel health improvements; after ten or more sessions, people may experience significant improvements in their health condition. After proper results are achieved, a maintenance schedule is required for some time.
