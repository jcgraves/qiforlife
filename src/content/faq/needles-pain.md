question: "Do the acupuncture needles hurt?"
order: 4
---

Most people are surprised and relieved to learn that acupuncture needles are extremely thin, about the size of a thick human hair—unlike hypodermic needles which are thick and hollow—and can produce feelings such as tingling, warmth, or pressure when inserted. Some patients have even fallen asleep during sessions, as acupuncture induces extraordinary relaxation in many people. Some report the sensation as energetic, but very few refer to it as painful. Dr. Zhang only uses disposable needles.
