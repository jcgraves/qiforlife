question: "How long does an acupuncture visit take?"

Your first treatment will be approximately one hour and involve an initial consultation as Dr. Zhang diagnoses and determines which Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments are right for you. After the initial consultation, she generally moves right into a first treatment during the same visit. Follow-up visits consist of a much shorter intake/diagnosis period before treatment, generally lasting between 40-60 minutes.
