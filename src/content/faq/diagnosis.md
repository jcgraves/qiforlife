Dr. Zhang will ask a variety of questions regarding your specific complaint and general health. She will use TCM diagnostic methods including radial pulse reading and tongue diagnosis. The initial consultation includes a standard health history not unlike a medical doctor's office. You will need to fill out a few forms provided on this website. Whatever first treatment is appropriate will be done immediately following the initial consultation.
